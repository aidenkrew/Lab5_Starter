1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

No since the the actual impplementation of message has more than 1 part so it would be hard to unit test it since it takes more than one small seciton of code.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

Yes since we are just testing one part of the message which is the max message length, that is something that we should be able to unit test.
